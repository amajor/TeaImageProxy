## Proxy Pattern Definition
 
> **The Proxy Pattern** provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### Remote Proxy

A **Remote Proxy** controls access to a remote object.

### Virtual Proxy

A **Virtual Proxy** controls access to a resource that is expensive to create.

This sample is using a virtual proxy.
